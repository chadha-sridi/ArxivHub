# 📚 PaperPal – AI Research Assistant

PaperPal is a **RAG-based** research assistant designed to help users:

- ingest and store academic papers,
- search and browse their personal paper inventory,
- view metadata and abstracts,
- take notes per paper,
- chat about papers using an integrated LLM agent,
- and maintain a vector database for semantic search.

⚙️This project is **under active development** and will later evolve into a scalable multi-user web app with an independent backend API.
